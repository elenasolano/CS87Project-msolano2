  Testing the hypothesis that the parallel time complexity follows the law
  [Funnel stage] + [Tube stage] = Theta([n((p-1)/p)] + [(n/p)*log(n/p)])...
    Yes: the time complexity of pi-DFT is Theta([n((p-1)/p)]+[(n/p)*log(n/p)])
    (Fit significant at the alpha < 1.759045e-07 level.)
  Testing the hypothesis that the 1st (funnel) stage is Theta(n((p-1)/p))...
    Yes: the time complexity of the 1st stage of pi-DFT is Theta(n((p-1)/p)).
    (Fit significant at the alpha < 1e-120 level.)
  Testing the hypothesis that the 2nd (tube) stage is Theta((n/p)*log(n/p))...
    Yes: the time complexity of the 2nd stage of pi-DFT is Theta((n/p)*log(n/p))
    (Fit significant at the alpha < 1e-120 level.)
